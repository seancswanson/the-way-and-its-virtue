## Inspiration

This project was inspired by various parallel readers out there on the web that bring these historically important texts to the people. Here are a couple of them:

1. [The Manual](https://psykip.vercel.app/) by Igor Bedesqui.
2. [Tao Te Ching - translation comparison](https://ttc.tasuki.org/display:Code:gff,sm,jhmd,jc,rh) by VÃ­t Brunner.

I'm always looking to learn from folks who solved problems before me and aim to create something contemporary and unique while paying respect to their contributions.
