Ruling a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish.
If one oversees all under heaven in accord with the Way, demons have no spirit.
It is not that the demons have no spirit, but that their spirits do not harm people.
It is not merely that their spirits do not harm people, but that the sage also does not harm them.
Now,
When neither harms the other, integrity accrues to both.
