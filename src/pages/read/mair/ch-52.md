Everything under heaven has a beginning which may be thought of as the mother of all under heaven.
Having realized the mother, you thereby know her children.
Knowing her children, go back to abide with the mother.
To the end of your life, you will not be imperiled.
Stopple the orifices of your heart,
Close your doors;
your whole life you will not suffer.
Open the gate of your heart,
Meddle with affairs;
your whole life you will be beyond salvation.
Seeing what is small is called insight,
Abiding in softness is called strength.
Use your light to return to insight,
Be not an inheritor of personal calamity.
This is called "following the constant."
