Heaven is long and earth is lasting.
Heaven and earth can be long and lasting because they do not live for themselves.
Therefore,
They can be long-lived.
For this reason,
The sage withdraws himself but comes to the fore,
alienates himself but is always present.
Is this not because he is free of private interests?
Therefore,
He can accomplish his private interests.
