In olden times, these attained unity:
Heaven attained unity, and thereby became pure.
Earth attained unity, and thereby became tranquil.
The spirits attained unity, and thereby became divine.
The valley attained unity, and thereby became full.
Feudal lords and kings attained unity, and thereby all was put right.
Yet, pushed to the extreme,
It implies that,
If heaven were ever pure, it would be likely to rend.
It implies that,
If earth were ever tranquil, it would be likely to quake.
It implies that,
If the spirits were ever divine, they would be likely to dissipate.
It implies that,
If the valley were ever full, it would be likely to run dry.
It implies that,
If feudal lords and kings were ever noble and thereby exalted, they would be likely to fall.
Therefore,
It is necessary to be noble, and yet take humility as a basis.
It is necessary to be exalted, and yet take modesty as a foundation.
Now, for this reason,
Feudal lords and kings style themselves
"orphaned," "destitute," and "hapless."
Is this not because they take humility as their basis?
Therefore,
Striving for an excess of praise, one ends up without praise.
Consequently,
Desire not to be jingling as jade nor stolid as stone.
