The pursuit of learning results in daily increase,
Hearing the Way leads to daily decrease.
Decrease and again decrease, until you reach nonaction.
Through nonaction, no action is left undone.
Should one desire to gain all under heaven,
One should remain ever free of involvements.
For,
Just as surely as one becomes involved,
One is unfit for gaining all under heaven.
