When the people do not fear the majestic,
Great majesty will soon visit them.
Do not limit their dwellings,
Do not suppress their livelihood.
Simply because you do not suppress them, they will not grow weary of you.
For this reason,
The sage is self-aware, but does not flaunt himself;
He is self-devoted, but does not glorify himself.
Therefore,
He rejects the one and adopts the other.
