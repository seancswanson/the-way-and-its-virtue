Knowing man  
and staying woman,  
be the riverbed of the world.  
Being the world’s riverbed  
of eternal unfailing power  
is to go back again to be newborn.  

Knowing light  
and staying dark,  
be a pattern to the world.  
Being the world’s pattern  
of eternal unerring power  
is to go back again to boundlessness.  

Knowing glory  
and staying modest,  
be the valley of the world.  
Being the world’s valley  
of eternal inexhaustible power  
is to go back again to the natural.  

Natural wood is cut up  
and made into useful things.  
Wise souls are used  
to make into leaders.  
Just so, a great carving  
is done without cutting.  


> **Note** UKLG: The simplicity of Lao Tzu’s language can present an almost impenetrable density of meaning. The reversals and paradoxes in this great poem are the oppositions of the yin and yang -- male/female, light/dark, glory/modesty -- but the “knowing and being” of them, the balancing act, results in neither stasis nor synthesis. The riverbed in which power runs leads back, the patterns of power lead back, the valley where power is contained leads back -- to the forever new, endless, straightforward way. Reversal, recurrence, are the movement, and yet the movement is onward.
