The greatest power is the gift  
of following the Way alone.  
How the Way does things  
is hard to grasp, elusive.  
Elusive, yes, hard to grasp,  
yet there are thoughts in it.  
Hard to grasp, yes, elusive,  
yet there are things in it.  
Hard to make out, yes, and obscure,  
yet there is spirit in it,  
veritable spirit.  
There is certainty in it.  
From long, long ago till now  
it has kept its name.  
So it saw  
the beginning of everything.  
How do I know  
anything about the beginning?  
By this.  


> **Note** UKLG: Mysticism rises from and returns to the irreducible, unsayable reality of “this.” “This” is the Way. This is the way.
