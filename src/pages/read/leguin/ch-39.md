Those who of old got to be whole:  

Heaven through its wholeness is pure;  
earth through its wholeness is steady;  
spirit through its wholeness is potent;  
the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers;  
the ten thousand things through their wholeness live;  
rulers through their wholeness have authority.  
Their wholeness makes them what they are.  

Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate;  
without what steadies it, earth would crack apart;  
without what makes it potent, spirit would fail;  
without what fills it, the valley would run dry;  
without what quickens them, the ten thousand things would die;  
without what authorizes them, rulers would fall.  

The root of the noble is in the common,  
the high stands on what’s below.  
Princes and kings call themselves  
“orphans, widowers, beggars,”  
to get themselves rooted in the dirt.  

A multiplicity of riches  
is poverty.  
Jade is praised as precious,  
but its strength is being stone.
