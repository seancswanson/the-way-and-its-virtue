Which is nearer,  
name or self?  
Which is dearer,  
self or wealth?  
Which gives more pain,  
loss or gain?  

All you grasp will be thrown away.  
All you hoard will be utterly lost.  

Contentment keeps disgrace away.  
Restraint keeps you out of danger  
so you can go on for a long, long time.
