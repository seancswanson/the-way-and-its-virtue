If my mind’s modest,  
I walk the great way.  
Arrogance  
is all I fear.  

The great way is low and plain,  
but people like shortcuts over the mountains.  

The palace is full of splendor  
and the fields are full of weeds  
and the granaries are full of nothing.  

People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes,  
carrying weapons,  
drinking a lot and eating a lot,  
having a lot of things, a lot of money:  
shameless thieves.  
Surely their way  
isn’t the way.
