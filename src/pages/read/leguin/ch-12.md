The five colors  
blind our eyes.  
The five notes  
deafen our ears.  
The five flavors  
dull our taste.  

Racing, chasing, hunting,  
drives people crazy.  
Trying to get rich  
ties people in knots.  

So the wise soul  
watches with the inner  
not the outward eye,  
letting that go,  
keeping this.
