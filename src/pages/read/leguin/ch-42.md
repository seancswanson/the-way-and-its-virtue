---
The Way bears one.  
The one bears two.  
The two bear three.  
The three bear the ten thousand things.  
The ten thousand things  
carry the yin on their shoulders  
and hold in their arms the yang,  
whose interplay of energy  
makes harmony.  

People despise  
orphans, widowers, outcasts.  
Yet that’s what kings and rulers call themselves.  
Whatever you lose, you’ve won.  
Whatever you win, you’ve lost.  

What others teach, I say too:  
violence and aggression  
destroy themselves.  
My teaching rests on that.  


> **Note** UKLG: Beginning with a pocket cosmology, this chapter demonstrates the “interplay of energy” of yin and yang by showing how low and high, winning and losing, destruction and self-destruction, reverse themselves, each turning into its seeming opposite.
