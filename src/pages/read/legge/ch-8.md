1. The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence
of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying,
without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike.
Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. 

2. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place;
that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is
in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing
good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and
that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.

3. And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about
his low position), no one finds fault with him.
