1. My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but
there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise
them. 

2. There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my
words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce).
It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me.

3. They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to
be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth,
while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom.
