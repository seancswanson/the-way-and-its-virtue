1. In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there
were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them.
In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus
it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers)
a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). 

2. How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by
their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their
work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people
all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'
