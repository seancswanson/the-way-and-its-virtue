1. That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage
and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower
than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it
is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by
his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person
behind them. 

2. In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel
his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel
it an injury to them. 

3. Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary
of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive
with him.
