1. Who thinks his great achievements poor 
Shall find his vigour long endure. 
Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, 
Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. 
Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; 
Thy greatest art still stupid seem, 
And eloquence a stammering scream. 

2. Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity
and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.
