1. There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and
yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing
that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual)
for which it can be changed. 

2. Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard,
and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.

3. Therefore a sage has said, 
'He who accepts his state's reproach, 
Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; 
To him who bears men's direful woes 
They all the name of King accord.' 

4. Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.
