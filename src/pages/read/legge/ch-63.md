1. (It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting;
to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste
without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great,
and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.

2. (The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while
they are easy, and does things that would become great while they
are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from
a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from
one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does
what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest
things. 

3. He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who
is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.
Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so
never has any difficulties.
