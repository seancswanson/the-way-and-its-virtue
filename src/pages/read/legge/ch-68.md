He who in (Tao's) wars has skill 
Assumes no martial port; 
He who fights with most good will 
To rage makes no resort. 
He who vanquishes yet still 
Keeps from his foes apart; 
He whose hests men most fulfil 
Yet humbly plies his art. 

Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, 
And therein is his might.' 
Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, 
That they with him unite.' 
Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, 
No sage of old more bright.'
