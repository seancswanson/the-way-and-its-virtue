1. When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which
is their great dread will come on them. 

2. Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary
life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on.

3. It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not
arise. 

4. Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not
parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value
on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes
choice of the former.
