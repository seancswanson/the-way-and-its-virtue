1. The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment
of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable
it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things!

2. We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications
of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves
into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the
Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! 

3. I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before
God.
