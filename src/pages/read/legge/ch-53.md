1. If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to)
conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be
most afraid of would be a boastful display. 

2. The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love
the by-ways. 

3. Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their
fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They
shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their
girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance
of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and
boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely!
