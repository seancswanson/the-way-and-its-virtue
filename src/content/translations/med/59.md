For the regulation of mankind and the service of heaven nothing equals reserve power. [^1] Reserve power means a speedy submission. Speedy submission implies a rich store of energy. A rich store of energy means the subjugation of everything. Everything being subdued none knows his limits. His limits being unknown his sovereign power is assured, having the root [^2] of sovereignty which endures for long.

This may be described as a 'deep taproot,' and a 'durable peduncle,'--the perpetual vitality and continued manifestation of the Tao.

The Tao, the eternal THAT is all powerful because It remains ever beyond the attraction to this or that. Therefore the Lord Jesus taught his disciples that the way to obtain all that is needful for earth is to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.



[^1] Literally--"parsimoniousness;" "the harvest which must not be wasted."

[^2] Literally--"mother."
