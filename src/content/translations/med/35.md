Apprehend the inimitable conception, you attract the world; coming it receives no harm, but is tranquil, peaceful, satisfied. [^1]

Like transient guests, music and dainties pass away.

The Tao entering the mouth is insipid and without flavor; when looked at it evades sight; when listened for it escapes the ear--(yet) its operations are interminable.

Peace, prosperity, permanence of Empire, are according to the 72nd Psalm (attributed by tradition to Solomon), dependent on the righteousness of the King's rule--who apprehends the Inimitable, The Supreme, "The Hidden Wisdom" (I Cor. ii, 6-30) is omnipotent, "the Alpha and the Omega," the Ruler who directs the destinies of all. Yet THIS, which is ALL is NO-THING.

(Cf. The Classic of Purity.)



[^1] The text may be read in two ways and it is impossible to say which is correct. It may be rendered as in the translation, or it may be understood thus--"Apprehend the Inimitable Conception. Go throughout the world; go, without harm, you will remain tranquil, peaceful, satisfied." The Chinese may be read either way, and from the viewpoint of The Wisdom both interpretations are equally true.
