A person comes forth to life and enters into death.
Three out of ten are partners of life,
Three out of ten are partners of death,
And the people whose every movement leads them to the land of death because they cling to life
Are also three out of ten.
Now,
What is the reason for this?
It is because they cling to life.
Indeed,
I have heard that
One who is good at preserving life does not avoid tigers and rhinoceroses when he walks in the hills;
nor does he put on armor and take up weapons when he enters a battle.
The rhinoceros has no place to jab its horn,
The tiger has no place to fasten its claws,
Weapons have no place to admit their blades.
Now,
What is the reason for this?
Because on him there are no mortal spots.
