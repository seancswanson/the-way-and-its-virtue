Attain utmost emptiness,
Maintain utter stillness.
The myriad creatures arise side by side, thus I observe their renewal.
Heaven's creatures abound,
but each returns to its roots, which is called "stillness."
This is termed "renewal of fate."
Renewal of fate is perpetual -
To know the perpetual is to be enlightened;
Not to know the perpetual is to be reckless - recklessness breeds evil.
To know the perpetual is to be tolerant -
tolerance leads to ducal impartiality,
ducal impartiality to kingliness,
kingliness to heaven,
heaven to the Way,
the Way to permanence.
To the end of his days,
he will not be imperiled.
