Rule the state with uprightness,
Deploy your troops with craft,
Gain all under heaven with noninterference.
How do I know this is actually so?
Now,
The more taboos under heaven, the poorer the people;
The more clever devices people have, the more confused the state and ruling house;
The more knowledge people have, the more strange things spring up;
The more legal affairs are given prominence, the more numerous bandits and thieves.
For this reason,
The sage has a saying:
"I take no action, yet the people transform themselves;
I am fond of stillness, yet the people correct themselves;
I do not interfere in affairs, yet the people enrich themselves;
I desire not to desire, yet the people of themselves become simple as unhewn logs."
