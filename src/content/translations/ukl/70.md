My words are so easy to understand,  
so easy to follow,

and yet nobody in the world  
understands or follows them.

Words come from an ancestry,  
deeds from a mastery:  
when these are unknown, so am I.

In my obscurity  
is my value.  
That's why the wise  
wear their jade under common clothes.
