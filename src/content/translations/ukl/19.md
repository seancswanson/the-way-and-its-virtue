---

Stop being holy, forget being prudent,  
it’ll be a hundred times better for everyone.  
Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous,  
people will remember what family feeling is.  
Stop planning, forget making a profit,  
there won’t be any thieves and robbers.

But even these three rules  
needn’t be followed; what works reliably  
is to know the raw silk,  
hold the uncut wood.  
Need little,  
want less.  
Forget the rules.  
Be untroubled.

> **Note** UKLG: This chapter and the two before it may be read as a single movement of thought.

    “Raw silk” and “uncut wood” are images traditionally associated with the characters su (simple, plain) and p’u (natural, honest).
