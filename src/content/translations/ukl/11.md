---
Thirty spokes  
meet in the hub.  
Where the wheel isn’t  
is where it’s useful.  

Hollowed out,  
clay makes a pot.  
Where the pot’s not  
is where it’s useful.  

Cut doors and windows  
to make a room.  
Where the room isn’t,  
there’s room for you.  

So the profit in what is  
is in the use of what isn’t.  


> **Note** UKLG: One of the things I love about Lao Tzu is he is so funny. He’s explaining a profound and difficult truth here, one of those counter-intuitive truths that, when the mind can accept them, suddenly double the size of the universe. He goes about it with this deadpan simplicity, talking about pots.
