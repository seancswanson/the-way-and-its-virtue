The Great Way runs  
to left, to right,  
the ten thousand things  
depending on it,  
living on it,  
accepted by it.

Doing its work,  
it goes unnamed.  
Clothing and feeding  
the ten thousand things,  
it lays no claim on them  
and asks nothing of them.  
Call it a small matter.  
The ten thousand things  
return to it,  
thought it lays no claim on them.  
Call it great.

So the wise soul  
without great doings  
achieves greatness.
