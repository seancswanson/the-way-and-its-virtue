Be broken to be whole.  
Twist to be straight.  
Be empty to be full.  
Wear out to be renewed.  
Have little and gain much.  
Have much and get confused.

So wise souls hold to the one,  
and test all things against it.

Not showing themselves,  
they shine forth.  
Not justifying themselves,  
they’re self-evident.  
Not praising themselves,  
they’re accomplished.  
Not competing,  
they have in all the world no competitor.

What they used to say in the old days,  
“Be broken to be whole,”  
was that mistaken?  
Truly, to be whole  
is to return.
