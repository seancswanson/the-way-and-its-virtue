You can't keep standing on tiptoe  
or walk in leaps and bounds.  
You can't shine by showing off  
or get ahead by pushing.  
Self-satisfied people do no good,  
self-promoters never grow up.

Such stuff is to the Tao  
as garbage is to food  
or a tumor to the body,  
hateful.  
The follower of the Way  
avoids it.
