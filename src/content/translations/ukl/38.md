---
Great power, not clinging to power,  
has true power.  
Lesser power, clinging to power,  
lacks true power.  
Great power, doing nothing,  
has nothing to do  
Lesser power, doing nothing,  
has an end in view.  

The good the truly good do  
has no end in view.  
The right the very righteous do  
has an end in view.  
And those who act in true obedience to law  
roll up their sleeves  
and make the disobedient obey.  

So: when we lose the Way we find power;  
losing power we find goodness;  
losing goodness we find righteousness;  
losing righteousness we’re left with obedience.  

Obedience to law is the dry husk  
of loyalty and good faith.  
Opinion is the barren flower of the Way,  
the beginning of ignorance.  

So great-minded people  
abide in the kernel not the husk,  
in the fruit not the flower,  
letting the one go, keeping the other.  


> **Note** UKLG: A vast, dense argument in a minimum of words, this poem lays out the Taoist values in steeply descending order: the Way and its power; goodness (humane feeling); righteousness (morality); and -- a very distance last -- obedience (law and order). The word I render as “opinion” can be read as “knowing too soon”: the mind obeying orders, judging before the evidence is in, closed to fruitful perception and learning.
