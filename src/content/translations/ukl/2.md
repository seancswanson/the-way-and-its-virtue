Everybody on earth knowing  
that beauty is beautiful  
makes ugliness.

Everybody knowing  
that goodness is good  
makes wickedness.

For being and nonbeing  
arise together;  
hard and easy  
complete each other;  
high and low  
depend on each other;  
note and voice  
make the music together;  
before and after  
follow each other.

That's why the wise soul  
does without doing,  
teaches without talking.

The things of this world  
exist, they are;  
you can't refuse them.

To bear and not to own;  
to act and not lay claim;  
to do the work and let it go.  
for just letting it go  
is what makes it stay.

> **Note** UKLG: One of the things I read in this chapter is that values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world. To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance. To let go of that belief is to find safety.
