The way you can go  
isn't the real way.  
The name you can say  
isn't the real name.

Heaven and earth  
begin in the unnamed:  
name's the mother  
of the ten thousand things.

So the unwanted soul  
sees what's hidden,  
and the ever-wanting soul  
sees only what it wants.

Two things, one origin,  
but different in name,  
whose identity is mystery.  
Mystery of all mysteries!  
The door to the hidden.

> **Note** UKLG: A satisfactory translation of this chapter is, I believe, perfectly impossible. It contains the book. I think of it as the Aleph, in Borges's story: if you can see it rightly, it contains everything.
