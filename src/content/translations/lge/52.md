What (Tao's) skilful planter plants 
Can never be uptorn; 
What his skilful arms enfold, 
From him can ne'er be borne. 
Sons shall bring in lengthening line, 
Sacrifices to his shrine. 

Tao when nursed within one's self, 
His vigour will make true; 
And where the family it rules 
What riches will accrue! 
The neighbourhood where it prevails 
In thriving will abound; 
And when 'tis seen throughout the state, 
Good fortune will be found. 
Employ it the kingdom o'er, 
And men thrive all around. 

In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state;
and in the kingdom. 

How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation).
