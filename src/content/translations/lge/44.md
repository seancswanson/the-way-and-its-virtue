Or fame or life, 
Which do you hold more dear? 
Or life or wealth, 
To which would you adhere? 
Keep life and lose those other things; 
Keep them and lose your life:--which brings 
Sorrow and pain more near? 

Thus we may see, 
Who cleaves to fame 
Rejects what is more great; 
Who loves large stores 
Gives up the richer state. 

Who is content 
Needs fear no shame. 
Who knows to stop 
Incurs no blame. 
From danger free 
Long live shall he.
