1. Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who
   are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious
   are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively
   learned; the extensively learned do not know it.

2. The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends
   for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he
   gives to others, the more does he have himself.

3. With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with
   all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.
