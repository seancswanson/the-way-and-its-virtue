1. It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry
it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened,
the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. 

2. When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them
safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil
on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished,
to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven.
