1. Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong.
(So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth,
are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. 

2. Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death;
softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. 

3. Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer;
and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and
thereby invites the feller.) 

4. Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that
of what is soft and weak is above.
