1. Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep
the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which
are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves;
not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way
to keep their minds from disorder. 

2. Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties
their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens
their bones. 

3. He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without
desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them
from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from
action, good order is universal.
