1. All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing
operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each,
and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition.
Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its
outflowing operation. 

2. This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not
the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.

3. Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them,
brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures
them, maintains them, and overspreads them. 

4. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them;
it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability
in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over
them;--this is called its mysterious operation.
