1. Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful,
it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao
do not like to employ them. 

2. The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable
place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are
instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior
man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose
are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable.
To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of
men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will
in the kingdom. 

3. On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized
position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in
command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding
in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to
him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men
should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle
has his place (rightly) according to those rites.
