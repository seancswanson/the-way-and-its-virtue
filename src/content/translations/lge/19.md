If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers.

Those three methods (of government) 
Thought olden ways in elegance did fail 
And made these names their want of worth to veil; 
But simple views, and courses plain and true 
Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.
