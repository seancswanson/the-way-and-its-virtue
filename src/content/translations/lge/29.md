If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. 

The course and nature of things is such that 
What was in front is now behind; 
What warmed anon we freezing find. 
Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; 
The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence.
