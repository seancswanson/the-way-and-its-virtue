1. Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why
heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because
they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able
to continue and endure. 

2. Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found
in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign
to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has
no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?
